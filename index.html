***The Concept***
You may be wondering where i got the whole idea for this profile and to be complerely
honest i was aiming for something that was markdown but in html and i came across a 
documentation page that looked something like this page! After that i kinda just took
the version they had and modified it to be more asthetically pleasing and the i got to
this so i hope that you guys like it and its also somewhat inspired by how liscenses
are writen! give it a star at https://github.io/Thebombgamer/profile if you like it 
there may be some little secrets hiding in the code :3 have fun finding them.
